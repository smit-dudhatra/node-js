start is a special script that do not needs `run` keyword
just use npm start
and for other scripts
use
npm run `script-name`

for local dependencies use 
npm i --save-dev

for global package
npm i -g

for  production package
npm i --save

there are two types of usage for npm packages

1 > development packages
2 > production packages

nodemon app.ju
will thorow error
because in terminal we can run only global packages
and in npm scripts it will look for local packages
so
npm start for nodemon app.js will be okay

for logical errors (in the case where we are not getting the expected result, and no error in
the terminal)
you can use debugger and breakpoints to stop the program execution at desired line and check
the variable value by just hover over the variable....

cultivate the habit of analyze the code with 
debugger always in the development mode
and read the theory slide daily
