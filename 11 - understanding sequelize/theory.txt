sequelize is ORM library - Object relation Mapping

sequelize needs the mysql2 or we can say that
sequelize has dependency on mysql2

sequelize uses mysql2 behind the scenes

instead of using findById, use findByPk

the npm don't rin the middleware , the incoming requests invokes the middleware

if possible 
try to define 2-way relationship for all models
like

User.hasOne(Cart);
and
Cart.belongsTo(User);

to get the advantage of all magic methods `get`,`set`,`create` etc..

though the course creator says the inverse relation is optional , always have a good
prctise and establish the inverse relationship as well..

magic method types

get >> to get the relation obejct
set >> kind of sync method in spatie >> just sync with the last provided objects
create >> with creating the data (only for 1:1 relation)
add >> old data remains as it is and new data is added , won't affect the old data

by implementing
both side relations
you can save data on either side

like 

you can save cartitem through

cart.addProduct(product , {
    through : quantity
})


product.addProduct(cart,{through : quantity});

both will work
