you can install multiple packages at sime time

like

npm i pug ejs express-handlebars

after npm5+ >> packages will be added to dependecies by default.

app.set("views","/views") >> it has already a views as a default value , if you don't 
mention this

if you anything in the template file , no need to restart manually or nodemon will not
restart itself , because templates are used on the fly
and if you change something the changes will be reflected automatically in the next retart

pug is the build in template engine
so we don't need to require it manually

handlebars is not the built in template engine
so we need to require ut manually

templating engine built in che k nai a tamne docs parthi khabar padshe ..

the method with which you are passing the data to the template is almost same for all the
template engines

ex :- you are passing the object to the render method

at the end
we will use ejs with the concept used in handlebars (keep logic in the js side and probably
put the seperate function)

when you set view engine
you don't have to mention the file extension for template explicitly while rendering
