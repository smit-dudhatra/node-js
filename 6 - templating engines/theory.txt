you can install multiple packages at sime time

like

npm i pug ejs express-handlebars

after npm5+ >> packages will be added to dependecies by default.

app.set("views","/views") >> it has already a views as a default value , if you don't

restart itself , because templates are used on the fly
and if you change something the changes will be reflected automatically in the next retart

pug is the build in template engine
so we don't need to require it manually

handlebars is not the built in template engine
so we need to require ut manually

templating engine built in che k nai a tamne docs parthi khabar padshe ..

the method with which you are passing the data to the template is almost same for all the
template engines

ex :- you are passing the object to the render method
