expressJS is all about middleware

middleware

middleware is in the end a function that funnled a request or say process a request and
either forward the request to the next middleware [next()] or 
send the response [res.send()]

res.render will not stop execution , it will continue to next middleware in the stack
where it founds (app.use) either in the flow or either in the controller folder or in the 
express router way

>> mainly for serviceworker.js and favicon
