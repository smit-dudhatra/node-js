>> why middleware startements encountered 2 times on terminal (specifically two times) ?

>> first is for actual url and second is for `favicon.ico`

>> do some practicals regarding of how the different request urls would end up in which
specific middleware ?
 means can we guess the actual output or exact middleware where the response will be
 got ?
 and in that middleware 
 what url will you encounter ?

 ex: /add-product
 in first middleware you will get >> /addd-product
 and in response sending middleware you will get url == /

 how and why this happened ?
