put more specific route upper side
and the dynmic route will be at the bottom side
ex

products/delete >> put this first
products/:id >> put this after products/delete 

to pass a local variable to the include , pass the variable with object key used in include
as a second parameter

when you extract query param , it always be the type of string

for path >> req.params.<name>
for query >> req.query.<name>

if you want to populate the value in the  input field use `value` prop and for textarea
directly put a value between the opening and closing tag of textarea
ex
<textarea>put value here</textarea>
